# DSA Visualizer

Hey there! 

This project will create a visualization tool for Data Structures and Algorithms. Through this, I hope to create visualizations starting with <i>sorting algorithms</i>, then move my way to data structures — <i>arrays, linkedlists, stacks, queues, trees, BST, AVL trees, graphs...</i>. 

I hope to not only have a visualizer in which we can tell the platform what we wish to see, for example, <i>button to create an empty linked list, then another button to add, remove, search elements...etc</i>

But, also to have a code visualizer! I hope this is able to help students and teachers when it is done.

If you have any suggestions on improving or collaborating, feel free to contact me!
